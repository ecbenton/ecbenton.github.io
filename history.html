<h3>History of the E.C. Benton Library</h3>

<p>
Designed as a chapel by the architectural firm of Dull and Dallney,
the Benton building was constructed in 1892 for the
Belmont School for Boys which had purchased the former
Cushing-Payson estate as its campus.
With seating for 125, the chapel was used until 1899
when the school was amalgamated with Milton Academy
and the boys left town.
The school's land was bought by outside developers and almost became
an amusement park, but fortunately that didn't happen.
The site remained unoccupied until it was purchased by
Col. Everett C. Benton in 1903.
The Colonel moved his family into the mansion,
Bellmont (for which the town is named) and made the chapel
available for public meetings.
Among the building's users were two new congregations which
organized themselves there before erecting and
moving to the Payson Park Congregational Church in 1913
and the Belmont Methodist Church in 1921, respectively.

After the death of Col. Benton in 1924 and the demolition
of the mansion in 1929, his widow, Willena, and her six
children offered the chapel to the town for use as a branch library.
Their gift was made in the Colonel's memory and in honor
of his many public contributions as a member of the
Governor's Council, Belmont's Town Meeting Moderator,
and the donor of a public library to his hometown
of Guildhall, Vermont.

<p>
Belmont accepted the chapel, made the necessary renovations
to convert it to a library, and officially opened it as
the Benton Branch Library on June 10, 1930.
The Benton Branch remained in use until it was closed
in January 2009, due to budgetary difficulties within the town.
In 2011 the Belmont Board of selectman licensed the
Benton building to the non-profit Friends of the Benton Library.
It reopened in May of 2011 as the Everett C. Benton Library,
an independent community library.

<p>
The Benton building is a rare example of a late 19th century
country Gothic chapel built of native fieldstone with a
half-timbered and stuccoed entrance porch that used to be open.
It is notable for the fine craftsmanship devoted to its construction,
as demonstrated by its carefully laid stonework including a
cornerstone with documents, its study oak-timbered entrance door
with hand-wrought hardware, its elegantly simple wrought iron rooftop cross,
and its handsomely shaped arched interior beam work.
Aside from the shelving that was subsequently introduced
against the wainscoting, its interior remains almost
untouched, a single, soaring space with a high-crossed
beamed "cathedral" ceiling that is bounded by a large
arched Gothic window at one end and a raised
semicircular apse at the other.
