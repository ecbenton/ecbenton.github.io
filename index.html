<h3>Welcome to the Everett C. Benton Library</h3>

<p>
The historic Everett C. Benton Library is a non-profit
independent library run by volunteers and supported entirely by donations.
The library is located at 75 Oakley Road in Belmont, MA,
at the corner of Oakley and Old Middlesex Roads.

<b>The E. C. Benton Library will be hosting an outdoor block party Saturday,
May 7th from 1&ndash;4pm</b>.
The Belmont Community Chorus will be performing,

Our volunteer librarians are starting to return to the building.
Our hours will be spotty as we ramp up; if the flag is out please stop in.
We do ask that people wear masks inside the library.
We will continue to provide <b>curbside pick up</b>
as part of our lending library program.
<span style="white-space:nowrap">Email us at <a href="mailto:ecbentonlibrary@gmail.com">ecbentonlibrary@gmail.com</a></span>
to request a library book.
Free books will continue to be available in the lobby.

The Everett C. Benton Library established itself as a self-sustaining
community resource in 2011.
It is successful thanks to the many people who are involved
in staffing and maintaining the library
and to our generous financial supporters.
We are grateful to our many individual donors, the Belmont Savings
Bank Foundation and the Belmont Cultural Council.
</p>

<p>
We look forward to welcoming everyone back to the Everett C. Benton Library.
