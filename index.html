<h3>Welcome to the Everett C. Benton Library</h3>

<p>
The historic Everett C. Benton Library is a non-profit
independent library run by volunteers and supported entirely by donations.
The library is located at 75 Oakley Road in Belmont, MA,
at the corner of Oakley and Old Middlesex Roads.
</p>

<p style="max-width: 85%; margin: 1em auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1em; background-color: #ffeb3b; text-align: center">
The Benton Library is now open twice a week:
Tuesday mornings from 10am to 12pm and Saturday
afternoons from 2pm to 5pm.
</p>

<p style="max-width: 85%; margin: 1em auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1em; background-color: #ffeb3b; text-align: center">

We will continue to provide curbside pick up; email us at
<a href="mailto:ecbentonlibrary@gmail.com">ecbentonlibrary@gmail.com</a>
to make a request.
Free books will continue to be available in the lobby.
We hope to resume our full schedule in the fall,
after our volunteers have had time to reconnect with family and friends.

The Everett C. Benton Library established itself as a self-sustaining
community resource in 2011.
It is successful thanks to the many people who are involved
in staffing and maintaining the library
and to our generous financial supporters.
We are grateful to our many individual donors, the Belmont Savings
Bank Foundation and the Belmont Cultural Council.
</p>

<p>
We look forward to welcoming everyone back to the Everett C. Benton Library.
