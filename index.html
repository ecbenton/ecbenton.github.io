Beginning in January of 2024, the Belmont Public Library will reopen the Benton
building to offer Children’s services while the new library on Concord Avenue

The Friends of the Benton Library is very grateful to the many volunteers,
patrons, supporters, neighbors, and friends who contribute to the success of
our organization.  We are also grateful to the Town of Belmont, the Belmont
Public Library, the Belmont Cultural Council, and the Belmont Savings Bank
Foundation for their help and support.

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">
The Friends of the Benton Library will remain intact as a 501(c)(3)
organization.  We are working with the Belmont Public Library to sponsor
activities during the next two years. Our books are in storage, our catalog
system remains intact, and we look forward to returning to the building in
2025.

The historic Everett C. Benton Library has been run by the Friends of the
Benton Library since 2011.  It is a non-profit independent library run by
volunteers and supported entirely by donations. The library is located at 75
Oakley Road in Belmont, MA, at the corner of Oakley and Old Middlesex Roads.
</p>

<p>
The Benton Library is a lending library with over 7,500 catalogued books
including a robust selection of best sellers and mysteries, as well as a
wonderful, ever expanding children's and young adult collection. Library cards
are free and available to all: you do not need to be a Belmont resident to
borrow books. We have computers available for public use and free wi-fi.
