The Everett C. Benton Library established itself as a self-sustaining
community resource in 2011.
It is successful thanks to the many people who are involved
in staffing and maintaining the library
and to our generous financial supporters.
We are grateful to our many individual donors, the Belmont Savings
Bank Foundation and the Belmont Cultural Council.

<p>
We look forward to welcoming everyone back to the Everett C. Benton Library.
