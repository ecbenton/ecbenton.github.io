<h3>Library Cards</h3>

<p>
You will need an Everett C. Benton Library card to check out our books.
There is no fee for a card.
Come to the library, fill out a brief registration form and we'll
be happy to give you a card.
Cards are available to all; you do not need to be a Belmont resident.
</p>

<h3>Lending Policies</h3>

<p>
Books may be checked out for two weeks and renewed unless someone else has
requested a hold.
Ten books is the maximum number a patron can check out at one time.
</p>

<p>
The Benton Library does not charge overdue fines.
A book that is three or more months overdue will be considered lost.
We ask that lost books be replaced or that patrons consider
making a donation to our acquisition fund.
For paperback books the suggested donation is $5 to $15.
For hardcover books the suggested donation is $15 to $25.
