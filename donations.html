<h3>Friends of the Benton</h3>

<p>
The Everett C. Benton Library is run by volunteers and supported
entirely by donations.
We get no financial support from the Town of Belmont or the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
</p>

<p>
Please join our efforts to preserve this important
and historic community resource.
Your donation will be used to help with operating costs,
such as buying books and paying utility bills.
It will also be used toward care and maintenance
of this historic building.
