<h3>Volunteer</h3>

<p>
The Benton Library is staffed by volunteers from all walks of life;
no professional library experience is required.
We can use just about any talent you have!
</p>

<p>
New volunteers are welcome and will receive training on how to use
our catalog system.
Each shift has two or more volunteers so you'll always have company.
The shifts are 2 1/2 to 3 hours in length.
Some of our volunteers come every week
for the same shift, some volunteers come as needed;
we set up our schedule a month in advance.
</p>

<p>
We're happy to have all the help we can get.
We encourage new volunteers to join.
Please stop by to learn more or call the library at
<a class="tel" href="tel:+16174840988">(617) 484-0988</a>
during our open hours.
